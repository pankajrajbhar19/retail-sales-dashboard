🚀 Just Launched: Retail Sales Performance Dashboard
I recently built a fully interactive dashboard using Python + Streamlit to visualize key metrics for a retail business.
This project helped me strengthen my skills in data analysis, visualization, and dashboard development.

🧩 Key Features:

📊 Revenue by Region (Bar Chart)

📈 Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart)

🍕 Revenue Share by Category (Pie Chart)

🧮 KPIs: Total Revenue, Units Sold, Average Order Value

💡 Built with:

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data processing and visualization

Streamlit for creating and deploying the dashboard

Dummy retail sales dataset in .csv format

🔗 Live Demo: [Insert your Streamlit app link here]

Excited to continue building more data-driven projects!
Feedback is welcome 🙌
